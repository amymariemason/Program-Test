######################### input

#creates/ formats as MRInput object
#The variables hdlc, hdlcse, chdlodds and chdloddsse are provided as part of the 
#MendelianRandomization packageas example data, and represent the associations of 28 variants
#with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and their standard errors (hdlc and hdlcse),
# and the associationsof the same 28 variants with coronary heart disease
# (CHD) risk and their standard errors (chdlodds and chdloddsse), taken from Waterworth et al.
# output: reports the causal estimate and its standard error, a 95% confidence interval based on
#a normal approximation, and the residual standard error and associated heterogeneity test statistic

MRdata_HDL_CHD <- mr_input(bx=hdlc, bxse=hdlcse, by=chdlodds, byse=chdloddsse)

######################### models

# implement inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method 
mr_ivw(MRdata_HDL_CHD)

# implement MR-Egger method
mr_egger(MRdata_HDL_CHD)

# implement mr_median method
mr_median(MRdata_HDL_CHD)

# all three methods & output table
mr_allmethods(MRdata_HDL_CHD)

####################### graphical outputs

#static graph illustrating the various causal estimates
mr_plot(mr_allmethods(MRdata_HDL_CHD,method="main"))

#interactive graph of the genetic associations with the outcome against associations with the exposure
mr_plot(MRdata_HDL_CHD)

mr_plot(MRdata_HDL_CHD, orientate=TRUE, line="egger")



######################### taking data straight from phenoscanner
#This code takes the file provided by PhenoScanner, and
#outputs an MRInput object consisting of the genetic associations
#with the exposure “log(eGFR creatinine)” estimated  in Europeans and reported by the study with PubMed ID
#26831199,21 and genetic associations with the outcome
#“Asthma” estimated in Europeans and reported by the
#study with PubMed ID 20860503
